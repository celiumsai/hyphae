# On-disk compatibility fixtures

Each versioned fixture is a byte-for-byte historical Hyphae data directory.
The engine test reconstructs it without generated indexes, opens it, verifies
the expected records, and proves that durable idempotency receipts survive.

Fixtures are immutable once their disk format ships. A new disk format adds a
new directory and test case; it never rewrites an older fixture.

The format-1 fixture is frozen release history. Its pre-release generator
remains available only as a reproducibility check:

```sh
python3 tools/generate_compatibility_fixture.py \
  --binary target/debug/hyphae \
  --check compatibility/v1/data-directory.json
```

The generator deliberately omits the materialized Redb index so the test also
proves that recovery reconstructs disposable indexes from authoritative data.

The immutable format-2 fixture includes KV records, a vector-space definition,
durable signed-Q15 vectors, a lexical-index definition, and all idempotency
receipts. Reproduce it with:

```sh
cargo test -p hyphae-engine --example generate_disk_format_2_fixture
cargo run -q -p hyphae-engine --example generate_disk_format_2_fixture -- \
  /tmp/hyphae-format-2-fixture
```

The generator's test compares the semantic JSON against
`v2/data-directory.json`; the checked-in fixture omits Redb and therefore also
proves snapshot-driven reconstruction of every materialized retrieval table.
