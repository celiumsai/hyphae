# Phase 8 release-candidate gate

Status: complete for the private, untagged `0.1.0` release candidate. Any
source change invalidates closure until the complete hosted matrix passes on
the new exact commit.

## Implemented evidence

- portable, bounded, atomic backup and verified new-directory restore;
- `backup`, `backup-verify`, `restore`, and `doctor` in the single binary;
- immutable disk-format-1 fixture that rebuilds its omitted index and
  preserves idempotency;
- deterministic Linux/macOS/Windows archives containing one binary;
- pinned native release matrix for Linux x64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64;
- installed-archive smoke on every native runner covering the documented
  offline KV, query, compaction, proof, backup/restore, and doctor flow;
- SHA-256 manifest, SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs, SLSA v1 provenance, keyless Cosign
  signature/provenance/SBOM bundles, tag/version enforcement, and
  nonpublishing full manual dry runs;
- bounded parser fuzzing on a pinned nightly/cargo-fuzz pair;
- concurrent load and repeated kill/restart plus backup/restore soak gates;
- executable install, upgrade, backup, restore, doctor, and verification docs.

## Local commands

```bash
cargo test -p hyphae-storage -p hyphae-engine -p hyphae-cli --locked
python tools/generate_compatibility_fixture.py \
  --binary target/debug/hyphae \
  --check compatibility/v1/data-directory.json
python packaging/test_package.py
python tools/run_load_gate.py
python tools/run_soak_gate.py
cargo fuzz run document_decode -- -max_total_time=15 -max_len=1048576
cargo fuzz run proof_decode -- -max_total_time=15 -max_len=1048576
cargo fuzz run snapshot_verify -- -max_total_time=15 -max_len=1048576
```

The default local Linux load gate requires 256 durable writes at concurrency
8, elapsed time at most 90 seconds, nearest-rank p95 at most 2 seconds, exact
global output, and resident memory at most 512 MiB where `/proc` is available.
The soak gate performs four hard-kill cycles with 32 writes each, verifies all
128 records after every restart, then backs up, restores, diagnoses, reopens,
and recounts the result.

Local evidence was replayed on 2026-07-16:

- Rust 1.96 workspace tests passed natively on Windows and on Debian WSL2
  with an isolated Linux target; Windows Clippy and rustdoc passed with
  warnings denied, and the complete Rust 1.89 MSRV workspace passed;
- root and isolated fuzz Cargo locks passed RustSec and cargo-deny policy;
- checksum-verified `actionlint` 1.7.12 accepted every workflow;
- the common Rust, TypeScript, Python, CLI, and MCP conformance suite passed,
  as did the Astro, Next, and Vite adapters and host builds without Hyphae;
- native Windows load completed 256 durable writes at concurrency 8 in 0.829
  seconds with 47 ms nearest-rank p95; peak RSS is not exposed by this gate on
  Windows;
- soak recovered all 128 records through four hard kills and a restore;
- document, proof, and snapshot decoders completed 11,265,594, 2,437,845, and
  1,459,161 fuzz executions, respectively, without a crash;
- two real Windows x64 archives were byte-identical at SHA-256
  `2141297a77b19fa1967641f81f03fefdd35adb69653561d21421fc6b06d7f25b`,
  and the extracted binary reported the expected product/API/disk versions.

## Hosted closure evidence

- CI covers stable Rust 1.96, MSRV 1.89, Linux/macOS/Windows tests, public
  client conformance, optional integrations, contracts, compatibility, and
  deterministic packaging.
- Security and Dependency Review cover RustSec, license/source policy,
  manifest/lock consistency, registry checksums, npm integrity and audits,
  and full-history secret scanning.
- Fuzz and Stress cover the isolated fuzz lock, three bounded decoders,
  concurrent load, hard-kill recovery, and backup/restore soak.
- Release builds Linux x64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64 archives; each
  extracted native binary executes the documented offline operational flow.
- Release assembly verifies checksums, SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs, signatures,
  provenance, and attestations. Publication is skipped without an explicit
  matching tag.

The repository remains private and no release tag was created during this
gate. The live pull-request checks are the authoritative evidence for the
exact candidate commit.
