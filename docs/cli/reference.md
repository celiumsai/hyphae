# CLI reference

`hyphae` is the only executable. It prints successful machine-readable
operation results as formatted JSON on stdout, diagnostics on stderr, and
returns a nonzero exit status on failure. Commands never start a listener
unless `serve` is selected.

Run `hyphae <command> --help` for the syntax shipped by the current binary.
This page explains semantics and side effects that do not fit in short help.

## Command inventory

<!-- cli-commands:start -->
- `version`
- `put`
- `get`
- `delete`
- `query`
- `snapshot`
- `compact`
- `backup`
- `backup-verify`
- `restore`
- `doctor`
- `verify`
- `serve`
- `remote`
- `mcp`
<!-- cli-commands:end -->

All commands also accept `--help`; the executable accepts `--version`.

## Common data-directory behavior

`put`, `get`, `delete`, `query`, `snapshot`, `compact`, `backup`, `restore`,
`doctor`, and `serve` require `--data-dir <PATH>` or `HYPHAE_DATA_DIR`.
Opening the path initializes it if absent, verifies durable state, rebuilds a
stale disposable index, and takes an exclusive operating-system lock.

Every path supplied to `--out` or restore destination must be new. Hyphae
refuses to replace an existing proof, witness, backup, or data directory.

## `version`

```text
hyphae version [--json]
```

Prints product/engine, API, and disk-format versions. `--json` is intended for
automation; the default is one human-readable line. It opens no data.

## `put`

```text
hyphae put --data-dir <PATH> --key <UTF8> --json <JSON>
           [--transaction-id <UUID>]
```

Atomically stores one document. The JSON number domain is signed 64-bit
integer only. The key's UTF-8 bytes become the durable key. Without a
transaction ID Hyphae creates a UUIDv7.

Output is a commit receipt with `committed` or `existing`, transaction ID,
commit sequence/digest, and transaction digest. An exact retry is idempotent;
reusing an ID for a different operation fails.

## `get`

```text
hyphae get --data-dir <PATH> --key <UTF8> [--proof-out <NEW_FILE>]
```

Returns `found`, the record or null, and `proof`. Without `--proof-out`, the
local read uses the ordinary embedded method and `proof` is null. With it,
Hyphae creates a canonical `.hyproof`, returns its snapshot path and digests,
and refuses to replace an existing proof file. Missing keys can be proven.

## `delete`

```text
hyphae delete --data-dir <PATH> --key <UTF8>
              [--transaction-id <UUID>]
```

Atomically records one deletion and returns a commit receipt. Deleting a
missing key is successful and idempotency follows the same rules as `put`.

## `query`

```text
hyphae query --data-dir <PATH>
             [--field <DOT.PATH> --equals <JSON>]
             [--sort <DOT.PATH>] [--descending] [--nulls-first]
             [--limit <ROWS>] [--proof-out <NEW_FILE>]
```

Executes the convenient local subset of structured query:

- no `--field`/`--equals` means match-all;
- `--field` and `--equals` must appear together and perform exact typed
  equality;
- at most one sort field is accepted;
- missing/null sort last unless `--nulls-first` is present;
- non-null values sort ascending unless `--descending` is present;
- the default final limit is 100;
- binary key ascending is always the final tie-breaker.

Output includes rows, optional next cursor, scan/match counts, and `proof`.
The local command does not accept an input cursor or aggregation plan; use
`remote query`, an SDK, or embedded Rust for the full v1 AST. Without
`--proof-out`, `proof` is null. With it, the complete query/result is bound to
the written proof and referenced snapshot.

## `snapshot`

```text
hyphae snapshot --data-dir <PATH>
```

Creates or reuses the canonical logical snapshot for the current checkpoint.
Output includes path, checkpoint identity, snapshot digest, entry/receipt
counts, and file length.

## `compact`

```text
hyphae compact --data-dir <PATH>
```

Creates/reuses a verified snapshot, selects a new log generation through an
immutable manifest, and only then retires the old segment. Output is either a
compaction report or an already-compacted outcome. Logical records and commit
receipts remain unchanged.

## `backup`

```text
hyphae backup --data-dir <PATH> --out <NEW_DIRECTORY>
```

Creates one portable backup at a locked logical checkpoint. The destination
contains exactly `BACKUP.json` and `snapshot.hysnap`; it must not exist and
must be outside the live data directory.

## `backup-verify`

```text
hyphae backup-verify --backup <DIRECTORY>
```

Verifies backup layout, manifest metadata, snapshot framing/checksums/digest,
and checkpoint identity without creating or opening a live data directory.

## `restore`

```text
hyphae restore --backup <DIRECTORY> --data-dir <NEW_DIRECTORY>
```

Verifies the source, reconstructs and reopens storage in a sibling staging
directory, then atomically activates the new destination. It never merges or
overwrites data and does not modify the backup.

## `doctor`

```text
hyphae doctor --data-dir <PATH>
```

Opens and verifies the format, manifest, snapshot, log chain, recovery state,
and materialized index, then creates/reuses a logical snapshot. Success prints
`status: healthy` plus recovery and checkpoint evidence. It is not an
in-place corruption repair tool.

## `verify`

```text
hyphae verify --proof <FILE> --snapshot <FILE> --anchor <64_HEX_CHARS>
```

Verifies a canonical result proof completely offline. The anchor is a trusted
32-byte digest encoded as hexadecimal. The verifier validates both artifacts,
matches the caller's anchor, reexecutes get/query, and requires the exact
result. It opens no live data directory and performs no network request.

## `serve`

```text
hyphae serve --data-dir <PATH> [--bind <IP:PORT>]
             [--bearer-token-file <PATH>]
```

Starts API v1 and owns the data directory until Ctrl+C. The default bind is
`127.0.0.1:8787`. A non-loopback bind is rejected before socket creation
unless a valid bearer token file or `HYPHAE_BEARER_TOKEN` is present. The
binary uses the audited default resource policy; inspect it with
`/v1/capabilities`.

## `remote`

```text
hyphae remote --base-url <ROOT_ORIGIN> [--bearer-token-file <PATH>] <COMMAND>
```

The remote mode never opens a data directory. It uses only the public v1 Rust
client and accepts `HYPHAE_BASE_URL`, `HYPHAE_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`, and
`HYPHAE_BEARER_TOKEN`.

<!-- remote-commands:start -->
| Command | Input | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `capabilities` | None | Features and effective limits |
| `liveness` | None | Process liveness |
| `readiness` | None | Engine readiness |
| `put --request <FILE_OR_->` | `PutRequestV1` JSON | Commit receipt |
| `get --request <FILE_OR_->` | `GetRequestV1` JSON | Proven get response |
| `delete --request <FILE_OR_->` | `DeleteRequestV1` JSON | Commit receipt |
| `query --request <FILE_OR_->` | `QueryRequestV1` JSON | Proven query response |
| `witness --proof <FILE> --out <NEW_FILE>` | `ProofV1` JSON | Verified witness bytes |
<!-- remote-commands:end -->

`-` means read the complete request from stdin. The witness command checks
the canonical proof path, response digest header, and exact file length before
writing a new file. Example requests live in [`examples/http`](../../examples/http/README.md).

## `mcp`

```text
hyphae mcp --base-url <ROOT_ORIGIN> [--bearer-token-file <PATH>]
```

Runs MCP revision `2025-11-25` as newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.
It opens no listener or data directory. The adapter enforces a 4 MiB message
bound and exposes five tools through canonical schemas. See the
[MCP guide](../../mcp/README.md).

## Environment summary

| Variable | Equivalent option or fallback |
|---|---|
| `HYPHAE_DATA_DIR` | `--data-dir` |
| `HYPHAE_BASE_URL` | `--base-url` |
| `HYPHAE_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` | `--bearer-token-file` |
| `HYPHAE_BEARER_TOKEN` | Token fallback when no file is selected |
