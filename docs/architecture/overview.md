# Architecture overview

Hyphae separates durable semantics from delivery surfaces.

```text
hyphae-cli (single binary)
  ├─ embedded facade
  ├─ HTTP server /v1
  └─ MCP adapter
          │
public contracts + client
          │
engine: atomic operations, query, retrieval, proofs
          │
append-only log ── snapshots ── rebuildable redb indexes
```

For the durable KV path, a write is acknowledged in two ordered stages:

1. canonical mutation frames and their commit frame are appended and synced;
2. the mutations and commit checkpoint are applied atomically to redb.

The log is authoritative. If stage 2 fails, the commit receipt remains valid,
the live handle refuses potentially stale reads, and reopen verifies the log
before replaying every missing commit. A redb checkpoint is accepted only when
its sequence and digest identify the same commit in the verified log.

Immutable generation manifests select the active segment and its optional
snapshot anchor. A new generation is committed by creating a new file rather
than replacing live state, so an interrupted migration or compaction has one
unambiguous winner. See
[`manifest-format-v1.md`](../storage/manifest-format-v1.md).

Logical snapshots stream sorted KV state instead of copying redb internals.
Each snapshot records the exact verified log checkpoint and has independent
CRC32C and BLAKE3 validation. The normative layout is documented in
[`snapshot-format-v1.md`](../storage/snapshot-format-v1.md).

Compaction commits snapshot plus next-segment selection through a new
immutable manifest, and only then retires the old segment. The interruption
matrix is defined in [`compaction-v1.md`](../storage/compaction-v1.md).

## Layer rules

- `hyphae-core` owns stable domain values and invariants, not I/O.
- `hyphae-engine` is the embeddable facade that composes storage, structured
  documents, query, and provider-neutral retrieval.
- `hyphae-storage` owns disk format, recovery, snapshots, and indexes.
- `hyphae-query` owns a deterministic typed AST and reference semantics.
- `hyphae-retrieval` owns exact vector scoring and provider-neutral
  abstention; it has no default provider.
- `hyphae-contracts` exposes wire models tied to canonical contracts.
- `hyphae-server` and `hyphae-client` communicate only through `/v1` models.
- `hyphae-cli` is the only executable artifact and composes libraries.

`hyphae-engine` was introduced only after the phase-2 durability primitives
were proven. Provenance joins the same facade in phase 4; delivery surfaces do
not bypass its public semantics.

## Data directory

```text
data/
├─ FORMAT
├─ LOCK
├─ manifest/
├─ log/
├─ snapshots/
├─ indexes/
├─ blobs/
└─ tmp/
```

Restore targets a new empty directory. Temporary output is verified and
atomically promoted; an existing live directory is never overwritten in
place.
